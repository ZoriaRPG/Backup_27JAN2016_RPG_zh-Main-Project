Gleeok Count
Body = 1
heads = 1 each
Head and body both trace with an id of 62 (gleeok)
So, gleeok is body + heads for counting.
	BUT...
	when a head is killed, the fire head counts as an ADDITIONAL enemy of both the same ID and type.
	
	So, if you have a 4-head gleeok, with two heads severed, 
	it counts as SEVEN instances of its ID (core, plus four heads, plus two detatched)

	We need to invalidate the severed heads by their tile ID...sigh...

As does patra. 1 ( core ) and 1 ( each orbit ) including BS version

Moldorm is 1 + total number of segments. 

as does lanmola ( 1 + segments in e editor ) 

Manhaldla (4 heads) traces as only one enemy of its ID (!) but the number of enemies traces as one (core) plus one per hand
the hands trace as IDs 0, 1, 2, and 3

Manhaldla 2 (8 heads) traces as only one enemy of its ID, but as 9 total npcs (ID, plus 00 through 07).

gohma traces as only one NPC, at all times.

Aquamentus is only one too

diddogger is also only one

dodong (regular, and BS versions) is only one

NPC ID 00 - None, or manhandla hand
01 manhandla hand
02 "
03 " 
04 " 
05 "
06 "
07 "

NPC IDs 00 through ?? are clearly reserved for system use.
