//General-Use Arrays with Getter/Setter functions
//12th January, 2016

//A generic array, pre-included with all quests. 
float stdArray[4096];

//! Because this is the first global array that will likely be declared, called from the 'import "std.zh"' 
//! directive in scripts, or from the buffer; as the import directive for std.zh is usually the very first
//! instruction in any compilation attempt; this array will automatically have the highest numbered pointer.
//! This means that if it is added after a quest is made, it will be unavailable for use in existing SAVES
//! but it will not change the ordering of other arrays, or variables. 
//! 
//! Thus, running the quest on an old SAVE will NOT break anything, but it allows a quest developer who uses
//! this feature FROM THE ONSET, before releasing a agme, to EASILY go back in, and add global values EVEN
//! after releasing a quest, and with people playing it, WITHOUT invalidating their saved games; and it 
//! WILL allow them to use the new variables. 
//! 
//! It's essentially a catch-all for questmakers, as a way to later expand a quest, without breaking player
//! save files, or requiring them to start from scratch, to play the update. 



//Data Handling Functions

//Get the value of any 'index' in the generic array.
float GetV(int index){
	return stdArray[index];
}

//Set the value of any 'index', to a specific amount 'value'.
void SetV(int index, int value){
	stdArray[index] = value;
}

//Increase the value of any 'index' by +1.
void IncV(int index) {
	stdArray[index]++;
}

//Increase the value of any 'index' by 'amount'.
void IncV(int index, int amount){
	stdArray[index] += amount;
}

//Decrease the value of any 'index' by -1.
void DecV(int index){
	stdArray[index]--;
}

//Decrease the value of any 'index' by 'amount'.
void DecV(int index, int amount){
	stdArray[index] -= amount;
}
